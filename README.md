# DesktopXR

DesktopXR is an OpenXR API layer that renders a desktop overlay in VR using DirectX 11 or DirectX 12.  
It is designed to be lightweight, easy to install, and compatible with standard OpenXR runtimes.

If you enjoy using it, all I ask is that you give the project a GitHub star and share it with your sim racing<br>
and flight sim friends.

This app will always remain free 🙂

Version: 1.3.1
